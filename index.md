### Which User Stories are Most Relevant?

* As a student, I want to type out my notes so that my notes are orderly and easy to read

    - Justification: The basis of our solution is actually having an editor for students to interact with in order to record their notes. This can be done in a variety of ways, like through typing out or handwriting notes. In addition to this, there should be standard modern document editors like a button that inserts images or shapes, as well as options for changing font colors and options like bold and underline.

* As a student, I want to save my notes so that I can review the material later

    - Justification: A significant portion of our proposal involves the use of our program as a notes program. Without the functionality of saving and accessing notes documents within the app, users would have to go through extra steps to download their notes when they finish and the solution becomes more complicated than it needs to be.

* As a teacher I want to be able to check on student participation so I can check on those that are struggling with the class and help them stay focused

    - Justification: Part of our proposed solution was to provide teachers with the functionality to keep track of their students. This user story covers all the functionality a teacher needs and therefore is very relevant.
