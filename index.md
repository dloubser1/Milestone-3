## Part A

### Which User Stories are Most Relevant?

* As a student, I want to type out my notes so that my notes are orderly and easy to read

    - Justification: The basis of our solution is actually having an editor for students to interact with in order to record their notes. This can be done in a variety of ways, like through typing out or handwriting notes. In addition to this, there should be standard modern document editors like a button that inserts images or shapes, as well as options for changing font colors and options like bold and underline.

* As a student, I want to save my notes so that I can review the material later

    - Justification: A significant portion of our proposal involves the use of our program as a notes program. Without the functionality of saving and accessing notes documents within the app, users would have to go through extra steps to download their notes when they finish and the solution becomes more complicated than it needs to be.

* As a teacher I want to be able to check on student participation so I can check on those that are struggling with the class and help them stay focused

    - Justification: Part of our proposed solution was to provide teachers with the functionality to keep track of their students. This user story covers all the functionality a teacher needs and therefore is very relevant.

## Part B

### Ideas for Alternative Designs

* User Story 1: As a student, I want to type out my notes so that my notes are orderly and easy to read. Ideas:

     - Keep with the zoom design and have tools and options available at the bottom
     
     - Use the design from word and google docs with all the options at the top of the page
     
     - Similar to the gmail format, have a small text window open in the bottom of a zoom meeting, with a small set of options at the bottom of the screen
     
     - For the inserting of illustrations/handwriting, we could use either a ‘tablet mode’ or a simple ‘pen tool’
     
     - Having the application be an addition to Zoom, or an independent service

* User Story 2: As a student, I want to save my notes so that I can review the material later. Ideas:

     - Saving locally, on the PC

     - Saving in a cloud that is related to the class

     - The menu to open saved documents could either be a tool at the bottom of a zoom call that opens a small list of options, or it could be an entirely different window as a home directory for all saved documents

* User Story 3: As a teacher I want to be able to check on student participation so I can check on those that are struggling with the class and help them stay focused. Ideas:

     - A list of students with a timer next to their name for the most recent edit.

     - A separate gallery visible only to the teacher to view the content of  students’ notes. This could look similar to a Zoom gallery.

     - When the teacher is given notice that a student hasn’t participated for a while, it could either come as a popup or develop in the form of the student’s name highlighting as red. A separate tab with a list of only deviating students.
