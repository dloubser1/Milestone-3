## Part A

### User Stories

* As a student, I want to type out my notes so that my notes are orderly and easy to read

    - As a student, I want to write my notes by hand so that I can write my notes in my own style
    
    - As a student, I want to insert illustrations in my notes so that my notes are comprehensive and have all the information I want in one place
    
    - As a student I want to use multiple colors in my notes so that my notes are organized and easy for me to read.
    
* As a student, I want to save my notes so that I can review the material later

    - As a student, I want to be able to edit my notes so that I can make corrections as needed

* As a teacher I want to be able to check on student participation so I can check on those that are struggling with the class and help them stay focused
    - As a teacher, I want to view a particular student’s notes.
    
    - As a teacher, I want to check when a student last interacted with their notes.

### Which User Stories are Most Relevant?

* As a student, I want to type out my notes so that my notes are orderly and easy to read

    - Justification: The basis of our solution is actually having an editor for students to interact with in order to record their notes. This can be done in a variety of ways, like through typing out or handwriting notes, and it has been found that being able to have different types of notetaking available is helpful for learning (Holland). In addition to this, there should be standard modern document editors like a button that inserts images or shapes, as well as options for changing font colors and options like bold and underline.

* As a student, I want to save my notes so that I can review the material later

    - Justification: A significant portion of our proposal involves the use of our program as a notes program. Without the functionality of saving and accessing notes documents within the app, users would have to go through extra steps to download their notes when they finish and the solution becomes more complicated than it needs to be. Also, in the same vein of the importance of taking the notes, having the ability to save notes is also just as important (Holland).

* As a teacher I want to be able to check on student participation so I can check on those that are struggling with the class and help them stay focused

    - Justification: Part of our proposed solution was to provide teachers with the functionality to keep track of their students. This user story covers all the functionality a teacher needs and therefore is very relevant. There is also precedent, which can be found through sites online, of teachers having a problem with participation and needing solutions, so putting one within the notes functionality is very relevant (Minero).

## Part B

### Ideas for Alternative Designs

* **User Story 1**: As a student, I want to type out my notes so that my notes are orderly and easy to read. Ideas:

     - Keep with the zoom design and have tools and options available at the bottom
     
     - Use the design from word and google docs with all the options at the top of the page
     
     - Similar to the gmail format, have a small text window open in the bottom of a zoom meeting, with a small set of options at the bottom of the screen
     
     - For the inserting of illustrations/handwriting, we could use either a ‘tablet mode’ or a simple ‘pen tool’
     
     - Having the application be an addition to Zoom, or an independent service

* **User Story 2**: As a student, I want to save my notes so that I can review the material later. Ideas:

     - Saving locally, on the PC

     - Saving in a cloud that is related to the class

     - The menu to open saved documents could either be a tool at the bottom of a zoom call that opens a small list of options, or it could be an entirely different window as a home directory for all saved documents

* **User Story 3**: As a teacher I want to be able to check on student participation so I can check on those that are struggling with the class and help them stay focused. Ideas:

     - A list of students with a timer next to their name for the most recent edit.

     - A separate gallery visible only to the teacher to view the content of  students’ notes. This could look similar to a Zoom gallery.

     - When the teacher is given notice that a student hasn’t participated for a while, it could either come as a popup or develop in the form of the student’s name highlighting as red. A separate tab with a list of only deviating students.

### Wireframes

* **User Story 1**:

     - **Version 1**:

     - ![wireframe 1 1](/imgs/wireframe1/Clicked_Existing_Note_to_Edit.png)

     - ![wireframe 1 2](/imgs/wireframe1/Main_Notepad_Open.png)

     - ![wireframe 1 3](/imgs/wireframe1/Main_Notepad_Open_View_Options.png)

     - Justification: Our first design we came up with, it has a split screen view with different options on top. Passed on this version b/c we felt the notepad took up way too much space, and that the lecture itself would be hard to view with this sort of design.
     
     - Links: [Wireframe 1 Page 1](/imgs/wireframe1/Clicked_Existing_Note_to_Edit.png), [Wireframe 1 Page 2](/imgs/wireframe1/Main_Notepad_Open.png), [Wireframe 1 Page 3](/imgs/wireframe1/Main_Notepad_Open_View_Options.png)

     - **Version 2**:
     
     - ![wireframe 2 1](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_1.png)

     - ![wireframe 2 2](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_2.png)

     - ![wireframe 2 3](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_3.png)

     - ![wireframe 2 4](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_4.png)

     - ![wireframe 2 5](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_5.png)

     - Justification: Notepad implemented as a pop-up that can be simultaneously viewed with video, without being intrusive. It supports text/pen input. It has color-coding, text resizing, and bullet-point listing.

     - Links: [Wireframe 2 Page 1](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_1.png), [Wireframe 2 Page 2](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_2.png), [Wireframe 2 Page 3](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_3.png), [Wireframe 2 Page 4](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_4.png), [Wireframe 2 Page 5](/imgs/wireframe2/Wireframe_2_5.png)

* **User Story 2**:

     - **Version 1**:

     - ![wireframe 3 1](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_4.png)

     - ![wireframe 3 2](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_5.png)

     - Justification: We wanted the design to not be overly intrusive on the application, so we thought of imitating the “File” dropdown menu that appears in document editors like Google docs and Word, with options contained in the dropdown.

     - Links: [Wireframe 3 Page 1](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_4.png), [Wireframe 3 Page 2](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_5.png)

     - **Version 2**:

     - ![wireframe 4 1](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_1.png)

     - ![wireframe 4 2](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_2.png)

     - Justification: We decided that there needed to be a consistent theme if the application was to be an add-on to Zoom, so having the button be an addition to the standard Zoom toolset was a key part this wireframe. It attempts to be in-line with the existing options on the various zooms apps. This is also the point that we decided that the saving feature should be within the editor itself, and not a button external to that, since it would be confusing. 

     - ![wireframe 4 3](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_3.png)

     - Justification: This was an alternate design for the Zoom add-on that opened a fullscreen view of notes, with a deeper look at the individual notes, like a displayed preview. This mimics some applications that have entire screens dedicated to opening previous notes, but doesn’t fit well in the Zoom format overall.

     - Links: [Wireframe 4 Page 1](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_1.png), [Wireframe 4 Page 2](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_2.png), [Wireframe 4 Page 3](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_3.png)

     - **Version 3**: 

     - ![wireframe 5 1](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_6.png)
     
     - ![wireframe 5 2](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_7.png)

     - Justification: This was the final alternative that we came up with, which is a variation on the second idea we had. We wanted separate options for Opening existing notes and creating new notes, so separate buttons that are both accessible was a reasonable choice. The save function is still within the editor, and not readily available without notes pulled up.

     - Links: [Wireframe 5 Page 1](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_6.png), [Wireframe 5 Page 2](/imgs/wireframe3/Wireframe_3_7.png)

* **User Story 3**: 

     - ![wireframe 6 1](/imgs/wireframe4/Wireframe_4_1.png)

     - Justification: We designed a timer that records a student's last edit and a button to switch from viewing students' videos to notes, so teachers can easily see who is engaged and taking notes.

     - ![wireframe 6 2](/imgs/wireframe4/Wireframe_4_2.png)

     - ![wireframe 6 3](/imgs/wireframe4/Wireframe_4_3.png)

     - Justification: The first wireframe on the slide was designed to look similar to a Zoom gallery where the teacher can view notes and timers. The second wireframe was created to be more compact and a simple list of name and timers was designed for this reason.

     - ![wireframe 6 4](/imgs/wireframe4/Wireframe_4_4.png)

     - ![wireframe 6 5](/imgs/wireframe4/Wireframe_4_5.png)

     - ![wireframe 6 6](/imgs/wireframe4/Wireframe_4_6.png)

     - Justification: These wireframes illustrate what idle notifications could look like. The first one was made to resemble a Zoom popup to notify the teacher that students had been idle for some time. The next two wireframes show what the wireframes on the previous slide would look like when students have not been editing their notes. We choose to highlight the names in red because that is a very eye catching color.

## Part C

### Mockups

* **User Story 1 and 2**:

     - ![mockup 1 1](/imgs/mockup1/Mockup_1_1.png)

     - Justification: Notes and New Note icon placed in the bottom right hand corner to balance out Zoom button placement, with the notes first appearing above those notes.

     - ![mockup 1 2](/imgs/mockup1/Mockup_1_2.png)

     - ![mockup 1 3](/imgs/mockup1/Mockup_1_3.png)

     - Justification: The team decided that a wide variety of editing options should be available based off the user stories we created, so adding options to change the color of the pen and the text as well as adding highlights and other features to vary the look of both the pen and text tool were necessary. To indicate whether the user was on text or pen mode a white highlight was added behind the active tool.
     
     - ![mockup 1 4](/imgs/mockup1/Mockup_1_4.png)

     - Justification: We felt that keeping a view of the Zoom meeting while accessing the notes options was important, so the menu was chosen to be small and off to the side. This option was the best design due to the minimal intrusion on the traditional Zoom app, along with the matching system to what Zoom already uses.

     - Links: [Mockup 1 Page 1](/imgs/mockup1/Mockup_1_1.png), [Mockup 1 Page 2](/imgs/mockup1/Mockup_1_2.png), [Mockup 1 Page 3](/imgs/mockup1/Mockup_1_3.png), [Mockup 1 Page 4](/imgs/mockup1/Mockup_1_4.png)

* **User Story 3**:

     - ![mockup 2 1](/imgs/mockup2/Mockup_2_1.png)

     - ![mockup 2 2](/imgs/mockup2/Mockup_2_2.png)

     - Justification: The more compact, list design was decided as the best because it took up less room than the gallery and it allowed for the teacher to still clearly see their video and controls. On the second mockup view, we decided that the "Notes" button would bring up a screenshot of a student's notes, instead of a live video. 

     - ![mockup 2 3](/imgs/mockup2/Mockup_2_3.png)

     - ![mockup 2 4](/imgs/mockup2/Mockup_2_4.png)

     - Justification: The idle notification popup is only visible to teachers because it would cause a bit of a distraction to students. The red coloring of students' names was a carry over from the wireframes and we stuck with it because red text is still eye catching, yet not too distracting to teachers during a lecture.

     - Links: [Mockup 2 Page 1](/imgs/mockup2/Mockup_2_1.png), [Mockup 2 Page 2](/imgs/mockup2/Mockup_2_2.png), [Mockup 2 Page 3](/imgs/mockup2/Mockup_2_3.png), [Mockup 2 Page 4](/imgs/mockup2/Mockup_2_4.png)
